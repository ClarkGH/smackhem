- Just a guy playing with WebGL. Solo project for now.

## Paradigms and Intent

Inspired by crosscode's use of web technologies. Since that's what I'm comfortable with, I figure it's the best first-step into putting a game I'm proud of up for other people to play. Working with 2D/3D paradigms mainly for fun and learning.

-No PRs while solo, there's no need to show that a single dev can make prs against his own work
-Using tasks to keep the demo project 100% on github

## Tech Stack

1. WebGL 2.0/HTML5 - Web-based engine for 3D model rendering.
2. Typescript - Language of choice.
3. Vite - Building/Bundling.
4. ESLint/Prettier - Formatting.
5. Node.js/pnpm - Package management.
6. JSON - Map/Chunk/Asset metadata.
7. Math - Custom Vec2/Vec3/Mat4
8. Target Platforms - Web -> Desktop -> Console(future).
