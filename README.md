- Just a guy playing with WebGL. Solo project for now.

## Paradigms and Intent

Inspired by crosscode's use of web technologies. Since that's what I'm comfortable with, I figure it's the best first-step into putting a game I'm proud of up for other people to play. Working with 2D/3D paradigms mainly for fun and learning.

-No PRs while solo, there's no need to show that a single dev can make prs against his own work
-Using tasks to keep the demo project 100% on github

## Tech Stack

1.WebGL/HTML5 - Web-based engine for 3D model rendering
2.Typescript - Language of choice
3.Vite - Bundling
